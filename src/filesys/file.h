/* Loads a segment starting at offset OFS in FILE at address
   UPAGE.  In total, READ_BYTES + ZERO_BYTES bytes of virtual
   memory are initialized, as follows:

        - READ_BYTES bytes at UPAGE must be read from FILE
          starting at offset OFS.

        - ZERO_BYTES bytes at UPAGE + READ_BYTES must be zeroed.

   The pages initialized by this function must be writable by the
   user process if WRITABLE is true, read-only otherwise.

   Return true if successful, false if a memory allocation error
   or disk read error occurs.
